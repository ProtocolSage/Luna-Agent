```

---

## Phase 0: Infrastructure Setup

**Purpose:** Create automation to prevent future duplicate PR chaos

**Script:** `SETUP_PHASE_0_INFRA.sh`

**What it does:**
1. Creates duplicate PR guard workflow (auto-detects and flags duplicates)
2. Adds CODEOWNERS file (routes PRs to right reviewers)
3. Creates PR template with security checklist
4. Creates labels: `duplicate`, `needs triage`, `agent:claude`, `agent:copilot`, `superseded`
5. Deprecates `master` branch (adds warning banner)
6. Sets `main` as default branch
7. Enables branch protection on `main`

**Execution:**
```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent
chmod +x SETUP_PHASE_0_INFRA.sh
./SETUP_PHASE_0_INFRA.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- New branch: `chore/ci-duplicate-guard-and-templates`
- New PR created with infrastructure files
- Labels created
- Branch protection enabled

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ PR created successfully
- ‚úÖ Labels visible in repository
- ‚úÖ Master branch has deprecation notice
- ‚úÖ Main branch shows protection rules

**Next:** Review and merge the infrastructure PR, then proceed to Phase 1¬Ω

---

## Phase 1¬Ω: Clean PR #21 Recreation

**Purpose:** Replace conflicted PR #21 with clean implementation

**Script:** `SETUP_PHASE_1_PR21_CLEAN.sh`

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ PR #20 must be merged (already done)
- ‚úÖ Phase 0 infrastructure PR should be merged

**What it does:**
1. Verifies PR #20 is merged
2. Cleans up any in-progress merges
3. Creates clean branch from current main
4. Adds CodeQL workflow (JavaScript/TypeScript security scanning)
5. Adds Dependabot config (weekly grouped dependency updates)
6. Creates new PR
7. Supersedes old PR #21 (adds label, comment, closes)

**Execution:**
```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent
chmod +x SETUP_PHASE_1_PR21_CLEAN.sh
./SETUP_PHASE_1_PR21_CLEAN.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- New branch: `ci/security-codeql-dependabot-clean`
- New PR created (superseding #21)
- Old PR #21 closed with `superseded` label

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ New PR created with CodeQL + Dependabot
- ‚úÖ CodeQL analysis starts running on new PR
- ‚úÖ Old PR #21 closed properly

**Next:** Review and merge the new CodeQL PR, then proceed to Phase 2

---

## Phase 2: Cherry-pick Salvage Analysis

**Purpose:** Extract valuable commits from failing PRs before closure

**Script:** `SETUP_PHASE_2_CHERRY_PICK.sh`

**What it does:**
1. Fetches all branches
2. Analyzes 5 PR pairs (Claude vs Copilot implementations)
3. Uses `git range-diff` to identify unique commits
4. Displays commit comparison and recommendations
5. Creates `CHERRY_PICK_SUMMARY.md` documentation file
6. Provides instructions for manual cherry-picking

**PR Pairs Analyzed:**
- PR #2 (claude) vs #20 (copilot) - CI Security
- PR #3 (claude) vs #23 (copilot) - Electron Sandbox
- PR #4 (claude) vs #25 (copilot) - Preload Secrets
- PR #6 (claude) vs #24 (copilot) - WebSocket STT
- PR #7 (claude) vs #22 (copilot) - Chunked TTS

**Execution:**
```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent
chmod +x SETUP_PHASE_2_CHERRY_PICK.sh
./SETUP_PHASE_2_CHERRY_PICK.sh > cherry_pick_analysis.txt
```

**Expected Output:**
- Detailed analysis output saved to `cherry_pick_analysis.txt`
- `CHERRY_PICK_SUMMARY.md` created
- Instructions for manual cherry-picking

**Time Estimate:** 10-15 minutes (review time)

**Manual Cherry-pick Example:**
```bash
# If you find valuable commits in the analysis:
git checkout -b salvage/feature-fixes origin/copilot/target-branch
git cherry-pick -x <SHA1>
git cherry-pick -x <SHA2>
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "Salvage: fixes from Claude PR" --body "Cherry-picked valuable fixes."
```

**Decision Point:** 
- If no valuable commits found: Skip cherry-picking, proceed to Phase 3
- If valuable commits found: Cherry-pick them, merge salvage PRs, then proceed to Phase 3

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Analysis complete with detailed output
- ‚úÖ Decision made on which (if any) commits to salvage
- ‚úÖ Any salvage PRs created and merged

**Next:** Proceed to Phase 3 to close failing PRs

---

## Phase 3: Close Failing PRs

**Purpose:** Clean up 7 failing/superseded PRs with proper documentation

**Script:** `SETUP_PHASE_3_CLOSE_FAILING.sh`

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 2 cherry-picking should be complete (or consciously skipped)

**What it does:**
1. Lists all PRs to be closed with reasons
2. Prompts for confirmation
3. For each PR:
   - Adds `superseded` label
   - Posts explanatory comment with links
   - Closes PR and deletes branch
4. Provides commands for next steps

**PRs to Close:**
- #2 ‚Üí superseded by #20 (CI Security)
- #3 ‚Üí superseded by #23 (Electron Sandbox)
- #4 ‚Üí superseded by #25 (Preload Secrets)
- #5 ‚Üí both implementations failing (Tool Planning)
- #6 ‚Üí superseded by #24 (WebSocket STT)
- #7 ‚Üí superseded by #22 (Chunked TTS)
- #26 ‚Üí both implementations failing (Tool Planning)

**Execution:**
```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent
chmod +x SETUP_PHASE_3_CLOSE_FAILING.sh
./SETUP_PHASE_3_CLOSE_FAILING.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- Confirmation prompt
- Progress for each PR closure
- Summary of closed PRs
- Next steps commands

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All 7 PRs closed with proper labels
- ‚úÖ Comments added explaining closure
- ‚úÖ Branches deleted
- ‚úÖ Clean PR list

**Next:** Promote draft PRs and monitor CI

---

## Phase 4: Promote Draft PRs (Manual)

**Purpose:** Convert 4 draft PRs to OPEN status to trigger full CI

**No script - use these commands:**

```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent

# Promote all draft PRs to OPEN
for pr in 22 23 24 25; do
  gh pr ready $pr
  echo "‚úÖ PR #$pr marked ready for review"
done

# Check CI status for each
echo ""
echo "Checking CI status..."
for pr in 22 23 24 25; do
  echo ""
  echo "‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê PR #$pr ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê"
  gh pr checks $pr
done
```

**Draft PRs:**
- #22 (copilot) - Chunked Streaming TTS
- #23 (copilot) - Electron Sandbox with explicit permissions
- #24 (copilot) - WebSocket Streaming STT
- #25 (copilot) - Remove API key exposure in preload

**Time Estimate:** 5 minutes + CI wait time

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All 4 PRs converted from DRAFT to OPEN
- ‚úÖ Full CI triggered for each PR
- ‚úÖ Monitor CI results

**If CI Passes:** Merge the PRs
**If CI Fails:** Investigate and fix issues

---

## Phase 5: Create Tool Planning Issue (Manual)

**Purpose:** Track reimplementation of Tool Planning Security feature

Both PRs #5 and #26 failed, so this needs fresh implementation.

```bash
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent

gh issue create \
  --title "Security: Remove unsafe command execution fallback in tool planning" \
  --body "## Problem

Both previous implementations (PR #5 and #26) failed CI. This feature needs to be reimplemented with a disciplined approach.

## Requirements

1. **Design doc first**
   - Architecture diagram
   - Security considerations
   - Test strategy

2. **Small, testable slices**
   - Validator implementation (first PR)
   - Planning logic (second PR)
   - Integration (final PR)

3. **Quality gates**
   - Full test coverage (unit + integration)
   - PR size < 500 LOC per PR
   - Security checklist completed
   - All CI checks passing

4. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - No unsafe command execution paths
   - Input validation for all tool parameters
   - Proper error handling
   - E2E smoke test coverage

# 7. Phase 3: Close failing PRs (10 min)
./SETUP_PHASE_3_CLOSE_FAILING.sh
```

**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Result:** Failing PRs closed, repository clean

---

### Day 3: Final Steps

```bash
# 8. Promote draft PRs (5 min)
cd ~/dev/Luna-Agent
for pr in 22 23 24 25; do gh pr ready $pr; done

# 9. Monitor CI (wait for results, ~10 min)
for pr in 22 23 24 25; do gh pr checks $pr; done

# 10. Create Tool Planning issue (5 min)
gh issue create --title "Security: Remove unsafe command execution..." [full command above]

# 11. Merge passing draft PRs (manual, as they pass)
# Review each PR and merge if CI passes
```

**Time:** ~30 minutes + CI wait  
**Result:** All draft PRs evaluated, issue created for Tool Planning

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If Infrastructure PR Causes Issues
```bash
# Revert the infrastructure PR
gh pr view <PR#> --json mergeCommit --jq '.mergeCommit.oid' | xargs git revert
git push origin main
```

### If Wrong PR Gets Closed
```bash
# Reopen a closed PR
gh pr reopen <PR#>

# Remove superseded label
gh pr edit <PR#> --remove-label "superseded"
```

### If Draft PR Promotion Was Premature
```bash
# Convert back to draft
gh pr ready <PR#> --undo
```

# ✅ Electron Build Configuration - COMPLETE FIX

## All Build Issues Resolved

### 🎯 Problems Fixed:

1. ✅ **"Electron is undefined" error** - FIXED
2. ✅ **Preload script not found error** - FIXED
3. ✅ **Module not found in preload** - FIXED
4. ✅ **TypeScript compilation issues** - FIXED

### 📝 Key Changes Made:

#### 1. TypeScript Configurations

- **tsconfig.main.json**: Compiles main process + agent code
- **tsconfig.preload.json**: Only compiles preload script (no renderer imports)
- Both output to proper locations with CommonJS format

#### 2. Code Fixes

- **Path import**: Changed to `import * as path from 'path'`
- **Preload path**: Fixed to look in correct location (`preload.js` same dir)
- **Preload imports**: Removed renderer service imports (architectural fix)
- **STT interface**: Now uses IPC bridge instead of direct imports

#### 3. Build Process

- Main/preload compiled with `tsc` (no bundling)
- Renderer bundled with esbuild
- Webpack excludes main process

### 🚀 How to Run

#### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Build once
npm run build

# Then run Electron
npx electron dist\app\main\main.js
```

#### With Backend (for full functionality)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend server
npm run backend
# or if that fails, use:
node backend/server-simple.js

# Terminal 2 - Electron app
npx electron dist\app\main\main.js
```

#### Using Batch File

```bash
# Double-click or run:
start-luna.bat
```

### ✅ What Works Now:

- Electron starts without errors
- Preload script loads correctly
- Main process runs with proper Node.js environment
- IPC communication works
- No bundler interference with native modules

### 📊 Console Output (Expected)

```
[Main] Environment variables loaded from .env
[Main] Creating LunaMainProcess instance...
[main-process] IPC handlers registered
[Main] LunaMainProcess instance created successfully
[main-process] Main window created
[main-process] Application menu configured
[main-process] Global shortcuts registered
[main-process] Main window ready and shown
```

### ⚠️ Backend Notes:

The 401/404 errors in the renderer are because the backend server isn't running. This is separate from the Electron build issues and can be resolved by:

1. Starting the backend server (`npm run backend`)
2. Or running without backend features

### 🏗️ Architecture Summary:

```
Main Process (Node.js)
├── Compiled with tsc → CommonJS
├── No bundling (preserves require())
└── Runs in Electron main process

Preload Script
├── Compiled with tsc → CommonJS
├── Provides IPC bridge only
└── No direct renderer imports

Renderer Process (Browser)
├── Bundled with esbuild → ESM
├── Runs in Chromium context
└── Communicates via IPC
```

## 🎉 Success!

The Electron build configuration is now properly set up following best practices:

- Clean separation of concerns
- No bundling of native modules
- Proper module formats for each context
- Reliable and maintainable build process

The application starts successfully and all Electron-specific issues are resolved!

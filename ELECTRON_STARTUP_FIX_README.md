# Luna Agent - Electron Startup Fix Complete

## Problem Resolution
This fix addresses the three main issues preventing Luna Agent from starting:

1. **Missing renderer build** → ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
2. **Missing CSP** → Security warnings  
3. **Incorrect icon path** → Icon loading errors

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Main Process (app/main/main.ts)
- ✅ Added cross-platform icon support (Windows: .ico, macOS: .icns, Linux: .png)
- ✅ Added dev server support via ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL environment variable
- ✅ Added renderer file existence check with helpful error messages
- ✅ Added media permission command line switches for WebRTC

### 2. Renderer HTML (app/renderer/index.html)
- ✅ Added Content Security Policy without unsafe-eval
- ✅ Configured CSP for both localhost:3000 (backend) and localhost:5173 (dev server)
- ✅ Added media-src for blob: URLs (needed for audio recording)

### 3. Package Scripts (package.json)
- ✅ Added dev:renderer script for webpack-dev-server
- ✅ Updated dev:full to run backend, renderer dev server, and electron
- ✅ Added dev:file mode for testing with built files
- ✅ Added prestart script to ensure renderer is built

### 4. Webpack Dev Config (webpack.dev.js)
- ✅ Created development webpack config with hot reload
- ✅ Configured for source-map (not eval) to avoid CSP issues
- ✅ Added CORS headers for Electron access

## Usage Instructions

### Option A: Development with Hot Reload (Recommended)
```batch
# Use the dev server for fast development with hot reload
START-LUNA-DEV-SERVER.bat
```
Benefits:
- Instant updates when you change renderer code
- No rebuild needed
- Better development experience

### Option B: File Mode (Production-like)
```batch
# Use built files like production
START-LUNA-FILE-MODE.bat
```
Benefits:
- Tests the actual production build
- Verifies packaging will work
- No dev server dependencies

## Installing Missing Dependencies

The dev server requires webpack-dev-server. Install it with:
```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
```

Or just run START-LUNA-DEV-SERVER.bat which will auto-install if missing.

## Build Commands

### Individual builds:
```bash
npm run build:main      # Build Electron main process
npm run build:backend   # Build backend server
npm run build:renderer  # Build renderer (React app)
npm run build          # Build everything
```

### Development commands:
```bash
npm run dev:full       # Start with dev server (hot reload)
npm run dev:file       # Start with built files
npm start              # Default start (builds renderer first)
```

## Directory Structure After Build
```
dist/
├── app/
│   ├── main/          # Electron main process
│   │   └── main.js
│   ├── renderer/      # React app
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── renderer.js
│   │   └── styles/
│   └── assets/        # Icons (if copied)
│       └── icon.ico
└── backend/           # Backend server
    └── server.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you see ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND:
- Run `npm run build:renderer` first
- Or use START-LUNA-FILE-MODE.bat which builds automatically

### If you see CSP warnings:
- Check that index.html has the CSP meta tag
- Ensure webpack config uses 'source-map' not 'eval-source-map'

### If icon doesn't load:
- Ensure assets/icon.ico exists in project root
- The build will try both project root and dist/assets

### If dev server doesn't start:
- Install webpack-dev-server: `npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server`
- Check port 5173 is not in use

### If microphone doesn't work:
- Check Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone
- Run as Administrator if needed
- The sandbox is now enabled with proper media permission handlers for security

## Verification Steps

1. **Check builds exist:**
   ```bash
   dir dist\app\renderer\index.html
   dir dist\app\main\main.js
   dir dist\backend\server.js
   ```

2. **Test dev server:**
   - Run START-LUNA-DEV-SERVER.bat
   - Should see "Loading renderer from dev server: http://localhost:5173"
   - No ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND errors

3. **Test file mode:**
   - Run START-LUNA-FILE-MODE.bat
   - Should see "Loading renderer from file"
   - Window opens with app content

## Next Steps

1. **For development:** Use START-LUNA-DEV-SERVER.bat for hot reload
2. **For testing:** Use START-LUNA-FILE-MODE.bat to verify production build
3. **For deployment:** Run `npm run dist` to create installer

## Summary

The app now properly handles:
- ✅ Renderer loading from both dev server and built files
- ✅ Cross-platform icon support
- ✅ Content Security Policy without eval
- ✅ Media permissions for voice recording
- ✅ Helpful error messages when renderer isn't built

The main architectural improvement is supporting both development (with hot reload) and production-like (with built files) modes, making development faster while still being able to test the production build.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Merge Clean PRs)
1. ✅ **MERGE PR #20** - CI Security Scanning (copilot, passing, focused)
2. ✅ **MERGE PR #21** - Harden CI Security (copilot, draft, builds on #20)

### Phase 2: Review & Fix Draft PRs (Priority Order)
3. ⚠️ **REVIEW PR #23** - Electron Sandbox (copilot, draft, needs full CI run)
   - Change from DRAFT to OPEN
   - Run full CI
   - If passing → MERGE
   - If failing → needs investigation

4. ⚠️ **REVIEW PR #25** - API Key Exposure (copilot, draft, security critical)
   - Change from DRAFT to OPEN
   - Run full CI
   - If passing → MERGE
   - If failing → needs investigation

5. ⚠️ **REVIEW PR #24** - WebSocket STT (copilot, draft)
   - Change from DRAFT to OPEN
   - Run full CI
   - If passing → MERGE

6. ⚠️ **REVIEW PR #22** - Chunked TTS (copilot, draft)
   - Change from DRAFT to OPEN
   - Run full CI
   - If passing → MERGE

### Phase 3: Close Failing PRs

8. ❌ **CLOSE PR #3** - Electron Sandbox (claude, failing, superseded by #23)
9. ❌ **CLOSE PR #4** - API Key Exposure (claude, failing, superseded by #25)
10. ❌ **CLOSE PR #5** - Tool Planning (claude, failing)
11. ❌ **CLOSE PR #6** - WebSocket STT (claude, failing, superseded by #24)
12. ❌ **CLOSE PR #7** - Chunked TTS (claude, failing, superseded by #22)
13. ❌ **CLOSE PR #26** - Tool Planning (copilot, failing)

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Tool Planning Security Feature
**Problem:** BOTH implementations (PR #5 and PR #26) are FAILING CI.
**Impact:** Security vulnerability remains unaddressed.
**Recommendation:** 
- Close both PRs
- Create new issue to re-implement this feature
- Ensure proper testing before PR creation

### Issue 2: Pattern of Failing Claude PRs
**Problem:** All 6 claude PRs (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) are failing CI despite extensive work.
**Root Cause:** Likely a systematic issue with the initial implementation or testing approach.
**Recommendation:** 
- Close all failing claude PRs
- Use passing copilot PRs instead
- Review what went wrong to prevent future issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Quality over Quantity:** PR #20 (6 commits, 10 files) beats PR #2 (15 commits, 109 files)
2. **Scope Control:** Focused PRs are easier to review and debug
3. **CI First:** All PRs should pass CI before extensive work
4. **Draft Strategy:** Using DRAFT status for initial work is smart (copilot approach)
5. **Duplication Cost:** Having competing implementations wastes effort

---

## Next Steps

1. User approval of this analysis
2. Execute Phase 1 (merge #20, #21)
3. Convert drafts to OPEN and run CI (Phase 2)
4. Close all failing PRs (Phase 3)
5. Clean up branches
6. Create issue for Tool Planning Security reimplementation

## üöÄ PRODUCTION READINESS

### Ready for Production ‚úÖ

1. **Core Functionality:** All voice features implemented and working
2. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
3. **Security:** Proper IPC isolation and API key management
4. **Performance:** Optimized audio processing and memory management
5. **User Experience:** Intuitive voice controls with visual feedback

### Environment Requirements

- **Node.js:** v16+ (for Electron 37.x compatibility)
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Permissions:** Microphone access required
- **Network:** Internet connection for TTS and LLM APIs

### Deployment Checklist

- ‚úÖ API keys configured in environment variables

## üéØ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start Luna Agent
npm start
```

### Voice Features

1. **Wake Word Detection:** Say "Hey Luna" to activate
2. **Manual Voice:** Click microphone button to start/stop
3. **Push-to-Talk:** Hold Ctrl+Space to record
4. **Chat with TTS:** All responses include voice output

### Testing Voice Pipeline

1. Open `test-voice-pipeline.html` in a browser for component testing
2. Use voice controls in the main application
3. Test all three voice modes (auto, push, manual)
4. Verify TTS playback and wake word detection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN CONSIDERATIONS

### Minor Items (Non-blocking)

1. **Wake Word Sensitivity:** May require fine-tuning for different environments
2. **Network Latency:** TTS response time depends on ElevenLabs API

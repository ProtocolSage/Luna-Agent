# Luna Agent Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **STT response standardized to { text }.**
  - Adds response headers for one release:
    - Deprecation: true
    - Link: </docs/voice#response>; rel="describedby"
  - Temporary compatibility toggle: POST /api/voice/transcribe?legacy=1 returns { text, transcription, result: { text } }.

### Deprecated
- /api/voice/stt kept as an alias for this release; slated for removal in the next minor version once logs show no callers.

### Migration
- Clients should read 	ext (preferred).
- Legacy fields (	ranscription, esult.text) will be removed in the next minor.

- summary of this session
- I understand you want me to remember the summary of this session. Let me capture what happened:

  Session Summary:
  The user reported that none of the UI changes I had previously implemented were visible in the running Luna Agent application. Despite having
  made extensive code modifications (including LUNA PRO branding, voice control buttons, enhancement status banner, z-index fixes), the UI
  appeared unchanged.

  Investigation Results:
  1. Code verification: All my changes are present in the source files - the LuxuryApp.tsx component contains the enhanced UI with "LUNA PRO"
  branding, voice control buttons, enhancement banner, and fixed z-index positioning.
  2. Build system issue: The root problem is in the Electron main process - there's a webpack bundling issue causing Cannot read properties of 
  undefined (reading 'whenReady') error when trying to import the app from electron.
  3. Application won't start: Both npm start (production build) and npm run dev (development mode) fail with the same electron import error,
  preventing the application from launching to see any UI changes.

  Current Status:
  The UI enhancements exist in the code but cannot be seen because the application fails to start due to a webpack configuration issue with
  electron externals. The build process completes successfully, but the bundled main.js file has corrupted electron imports.

  Next Steps Needed:
  Fix the webpack bundling issue for the electron main process to allow the application to start and display the enhanced UI.
